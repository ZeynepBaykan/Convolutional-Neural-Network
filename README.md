# Convolutional-Neural-Network

  In this project, fruit recognition algorithm based on Convolution Neural Network (CNN) is proposed. For my project I used Fruit360 project which has fruit images. It has 120 different categories comprising of 59040 images. Images were directly used as input to CNN for training and recognition without extracting features.
Experimental results show that the proposed solution has an efficient ability to recognize the fruit with high accuracy.
